A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I spent all of the love I've saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
How many pennies in the slot
Giving us up, didn't take a lot
I saw the end before it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carried on
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this roller-coaster
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

Oh
Oh, yeah
Did I catch your attention? You look like you lost your breath, huh
When I circle the room, you an owl, you gon' twist your head
Don't you come at me green with an attitude when my lips and my soles are red
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks
No, no
'Cause I've been here once or twice
Never worry 'bout the eyes, come on
Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me
I can make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me
They looking at me
Yeah, yeah, they looking at me
May be young for a teacher, I'll teach you what you don't know
I could teach you the things that you wanna know
But I can't give it up all at once, you would overdose
Don't you bring any bull in the room tonight, it's a whole new rodeo
It could be you and me, but you know that I'll steal the show
Oh, yeah
'Cause I've been here once or twice (I've been here once or twice, babe)
Never worry 'bout the eyes (never worry 'bout the eyes) come on
Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me
I can make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me
They looking at me
No, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, they looking at me
But they looking at me, babe
'Cause they looking at me, baby
hey
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks
Don't just stand there staring, honey (honey)
Try to move your feet (try to move your feet now)
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me
I can make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me
(They just looking at me, they just looking at me)
They looking at me
(Yeah, they're looking at me, my baby, baby, baby)
Yeah, yeah, they looking at me
But the truth is they looking at me
They looking at me

Every inch of me is trembling
But not from the cold
Something is familiar
Like a dream I can reach but not quite hold
I can sense you there
Like a friend I've always known
I'm arriving
And it feels like I am home
I have always been a fortress
Cold secrets deep inside
You have secrets, too
But you don't have to hide
Show yourself
I'm dying to meet you
Show yourself
It's your turn
Are you the one I've been looking for
All of my life?
Show yourself
I'm ready to learn
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
I've never felt so certain
All my life I've been torn
But I'm here for a reason
Could it be the reason I was born?
I have always been so different
Normal rules did not apply
Is this the day?
Are you the way
I finally find out why?
Show yourself
I'm no longer trembling
Here I am
I've come so far
You are the answer I've waited for
All of my life
Oh, show yourself
Let me see who you are
Come to me now
Open your door
Don't make me wait
One moment more
Oh, come to me now
Open your door
Don't make me wait
One moment more
Where the north wind meets the sea
Ah ah ah ah
There's a river
Ah ah ah ah
Full of memory
Come, my darling, homeward bound
I am found
Show yourself
Step into your power
Throw yourself
Into something new
You are the one you've been waiting for
All of my life
All of your life
Oh, show yourself
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
