                    My name is Diana Huynh and I am currently a senior in Rosemount High School. My favorite color is blue or yellow. I like to travel around. Iâ€™ve been to Paris, Venice, and different states in America. I plan to go to either Japan or Spain next summer with my family before I head off to college. I also enjoy weightlifting, longboarding, and being in the outdoors. My favorite subjects in school is Spanish or psychology. Favorite holiday would be thanksgiving, because of the food.
